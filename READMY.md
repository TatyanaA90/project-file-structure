Project File Structure Activity

Objective
Reorganize the repository files following best practices to enhance project maintainability and clarity.

Tasks
Reorganize Files: Structure the project by categorizing files into appropriate directories such as src for source code, tests for test scripts, assets for images and resources, and docs for documentation.​

Update Imports: Adjust import statements in Python files to reflect the new directory structure, ensuring that all modules and tests reference the correct paths.​

Verify Tests: Run the test suite using pytest to confirm that all tests execute successfully after the reorganization.​

Create Essential Files:

README.md: Document the project's purpose, structure, and usage instructions.​
DEV Community

.gitignore: Specify files and directories to be ignored by version control, such as temporary files and compiled bytecode.​

LICENSE: Select and include an appropriate license to define the terms under which the project can be used and distributed.​

For additional guidance, refer to the hints.md file in the docs directory.
